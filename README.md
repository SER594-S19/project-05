Instructions:
1. Run server of the faceEmotions Team For seeing the performance of our Neural Network. 
2. Run client from Client/ClientDemo.java.
3. Our client is compatible with that team's Agreement and frustration emotions. 
4. We have provided labels based on the following criteria :
  - If Agreement is low && Frustration is high -> Label == bad
  - If Agreement & Frustration are around equal -> Label == average
  - If Agreement is high && Frustration is Low -> Label == good
5. The data for faceEmotions is saved in result.csv file.
6. Once you disconnect, the image will be dispalyed. 
7. Click the RESET button to erase csv file if connecting more than once to avoid concatenation of Data

** Please change path file of result.csv that is with respect to your system in ClientDemo.java
